# animalese-typing

A small, fun and somewhat annoying extension that will speak Animalese whenever you type online. 
This is the first chrome extension I've ever made. I was learning some html and css mostly on my own, and was curious to see if I could make something work. 
Enjoy! (This extension will not work in the google search bar and on certain websites.)
